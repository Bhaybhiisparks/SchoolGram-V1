  ## eSLINT error fixed 
  The react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:

  "eslint": "^5.16.0"

Don't try to install it manually: your package manager does it automatically.



### Babel error

## PROBLEM 
One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the​​​
​​​"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without​​​
​​​declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because​​​
​​​"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your​​​
​​​node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.​​​

## SOLUTION 
​​​babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which​​​
​​​is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will​​​
​​​ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to​​​
​​​your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message​​​
​​​go away
